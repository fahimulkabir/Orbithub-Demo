      "Artemis I, formerly Exploration Mission-1,will be the first integrated flight test of NASA’s Deep Space Exploration Systems: the Orion spacecraft, Space Launch System (SLS) rocket, with the newly upgraded Exploration Ground Systems at Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida. The primary operations goal of the mission is to assure a safe crew module entry, descent, splashdown, and recovery. In addition to sending Orion on its journey around the Moon, SLS will carry 10 small satellites that will perform their own science and technology investigations. The first in a series of increasingly complex missions, Artemis I will provide a foundation for human deep space exploration and demonstrate our commitment and capability to extend human existence to the Moon and beyond prior to the first flight with crew on Artemis II. Artemis I is foundational to the space economy, fueling new industries and technologies, supporting job growth, and furthering the demand for a highly skilled work force. Men and women in all fifty states are hard at work building the Deep Space Exploration Systems to support missions to deep space. NASA prime contractors, Aerojet Rocketdyne, Boeing, Jacobs, Lockheed Martin, and Northrop Grumman currently have over 3,200 suppliers contributing to the milestone achievement that heralds the success of America’s human spaceflight program.",

      "Named in honor of the trailblazing astronomer Edwin Hubble, the Hubble Space Telescope is a large, space-based observatory, which has revolutionized astronomy since its launch and deployment by the space shuttle Discovery in 1990. Far above rain clouds, light pollution, and atmospheric distortions, Hubble has a crystal-clear view of the universe. Scientists have used Hubble to observe some of the most distant stars and galaxies yet seen, as well as the planets in our solar system. Hubble’s capabilities have grown immensely in its over 30 years of operation. This is because new, cutting-edge scientific instruments have been added to the telescope over the course of five astronaut servicing missions. By replacing and upgrading aging parts, these servicing missions have greatly extended the telescope’s lifetime. Telescopes have a particular range of light that they can detect. Hubble’s domain extends from the ultraviolet through the visible (which our eyes see) and into the near-infrared. This range has allowed Hubble to deliver stunning images of stars, galaxies, and other astronomical objects that have inspired people around the world and changed our understanding of the universe.",

Juno arrived at Jupiter on July 4, 2016, after a 5-year, 1.7-billion-mile journey, and settled into a 53-day polar orbit stretching from just above Jupiters cloud tops to the outer reaches of the Jovian magnetosphere. Junos discoveries have revolutionized our understanding of Jupiter and solar system formation. During the prime missions 35 orbits of Jupiter, Juno collected more than three terabits (375 gigabytes) of science data and provided dazzling views of Jupiter and its satellites, all processed by citizen scientists with NASAs first-ever camera dedicated to public outreach. Junos many discoveries have changed our view of Jupiters atmosphere and interior, revealing an atmospheric weather layer that extends far beyond its clouds and a deep interior with a diluted, or fuzzy, heavy element core. Near the end of the prime mission, as the spacecrafts orbit evolved, flybys of the moon Ganymede initiated Junos transition into a full Jovian system explorer.",

The Mars Perseverance rover introduces a drill that can collect core samples of the most promising rocks and soils and set them aside in a cache on the surface of Mars. The mission also provides opportunities to gather knowledge and demonstrate technologies that address the challenges of future human expeditions to Mars. These include testing a method for producing oxygen from the Martian atmosphere, identifying other resources (such as subsurface water), improving landing techniques, and characterizing weather, dust, and other potential environmental conditions that could affect future astronauts living and working on Mars.",

The aim of the mission is to evaluate the kinetic impactor asteroid deflection technique. In order to alter a spacecraft's trajectory, this approach entails crashing it with an asteroid. DART is aiming for the binary asteroid Didymos, which is made up of the bigger Didymos and the smaller Dimorphos. Dimorphos is orbiting Didymos, and it will crash with the DART satellite. Dimorphos' speed is anticipated to be altered by the impact by a little percentage. Dimorphos's orbit around Didymos will be significantly impacted by this tiny speed shift, which will also further scientific knowledge on the use of kinetic impact to divert asteroids. The DART mission represents a significant advance in planetary protection. It is the first time that a spacecraft has been directed to strike an asteroid on purpose. The accomplishment of the mission will open the door for future missions that could divert asteroid threats to Earth.",
